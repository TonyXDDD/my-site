        <p>
          I’m 21 years old and currently a Computer Science major at SUNY New Paltz. 
          Alongside my studies, I work for both the IT Service Desk and Academic Computing on campus, 
          where I help maintain campus technology and assist students, faculty, and staff 
          with a wide range of technical issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Career goals: Once I graduate, I really want to use my Computer Science degree to 
          get into video game development. Ever since I was a kid, it’s always been a dream of 
          mine to become a game developer!!!!
        </p>

         Outside of school and work, I enjoy rock climbing, photography, and hardware tinkering on 
         both computers and cars. I love experimenting with computers, whether it’s coding or 
         building new setups, but when I’m not busy doing those things, a big part of my free 
         time is spent rock climbing with my girlfriend; either in a climbing gym or at the Gunks. 
         I enjoy two forms of climbing the most: (1) bouldering and (2) top roping. Whether 
         I’m coding, climbing, or creating, I always look for ways to challenge myself and grow.
